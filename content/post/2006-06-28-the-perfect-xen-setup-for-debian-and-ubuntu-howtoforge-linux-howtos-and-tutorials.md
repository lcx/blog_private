I think I NEVER saw a better howto in my life. It realy is a copy & paste howto, everything works as explained, great tutorial!
Now I have 3 vm on my AMD 1.67GHz and there are more to come. think I could turn of some computers at home after this.
I actualy could also install IPCop as vm … ok ok this is going to far, at least now I have a teset machine to continue with my [DTC][3] Cyrus tests.
