something funny hapened today morning. I went to my car an headed of to work and noticed a smal flyer under the wiper, nothing unusual. As I arived work I took the flyer and what do you think was on it ? “Carti de Acasa, “  ( books from home, in Romanian ) once again I can only say that we romanians are everywhere!
