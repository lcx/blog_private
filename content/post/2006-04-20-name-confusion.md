Sometimes it's nice to have a name that is also used in german but it written different then in german. Everybody writes my name with h ( Christian ) but in Romania Cristian is the correct way to write it. Well most of the time it really pisses me off when I see this, but today actually it was funny. I got a ticket for wrong parking, but the "officer" was to stupid to write the licence plate the correct way. Instead of CRIS he wrote CHRIS, and this means … no ticket for me since it's a formal error.

I wonder what the poor guy that will receive the ticket instead of me will think … "Berlin?  I haven't been in Berlin"
