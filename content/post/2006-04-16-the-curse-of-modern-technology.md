I remember as I was a kid, with 11 Years I went by train to Romania, this was in 1990/1991, I was all on my own on a train, nothing special one might think, me nither …

Ok there was some funy story at the end as I kind of got lost in Arad in the Train station, but this is not what I intent to write about now.
Ok now think today of sending your kid somewhere … allone. Also nothing special. So my sister ( 14 ) came to visit me in Berlin by plane. No she didn’t get lost,
but I forgot to turn on my mobile, my IP phone was not plugged in to power ( needed the power for a batery charger ) my sisters phone doesn’t have roaming and my last
phone had an empty battery … so 4 phones, none was switched on, and this was enough to create big panic over in Vienna!

As I switched my phone back on I received 3 messages and a message on the mailbox.
My parents where worried that something might have happened! Wow … they didn’t hear 24 hours from my sister and they realy wanted to call the police.

Now as I was my sisters age, the only way they could reach me was, call my uncle in Timisoara, he would have to drive over 30km to my grandmother
and then I could call from the postoffice to Austria. Actualy this never happened, nobody worried about anything,
not that I might think they didn’t care, but it was nothing to worry about.

But imagine this today, in these modern times with mobiles, email and all that nice stuff, how can it be possible not to hear something for 24 hours?
Now **THIS** is worrying me!
