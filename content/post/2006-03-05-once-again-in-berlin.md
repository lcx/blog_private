Here I am again, once again in Berlin, but this time I also have some minutes to write a blog and I also made some first fotos

and guess what! I also have internet and this already in the first week unbeleavable! T-Com was quite fast making the conection and the DSL itself I got from [Manitu ][2]where I don’t have to make a one year contract.
Well looks like winter is still present in Berlin, and I think I’m the only one around already with somer tires on the car, but hey …. no risk no fun

One of the best things here in Berlin sure is Dunkin Donuts, god I love their doughnuts, they make adictive.
This morning the first thing she sayd was “doughnuts”
I think I am already starting to mutate to Homer Simpson, only the duff beer is missing, but I thing “Heffe Wizen” will also do the trick.
ok but now enought about doughnuts, I am already starting to feal the need of them.
Lets get back to the nice city Berlin, got some nice shots at night from a litle bridge over the Spree near our apartment and also some nightshots from Potsdammer Platz.
Yesterday we also made a short trip to Checkpoint Charlie, and eneterd the “Mauer Museum” ( museum of the wall ), I tell you the place it much bigger then it looks like, so don’t get scared about the 9,50 € entrance. The bad news is that fotos where not allowed, so got no fotos from Mauer Museum.
After a big coffe we went of to the Siegessäule and that was about it for the first sightseeing day.
Now it’s time for some food and then doughnuts
