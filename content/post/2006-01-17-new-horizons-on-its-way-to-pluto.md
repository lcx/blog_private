Nasa has started theis expedition to our farest planet, Pluto. Its 6 bilion (.mrd) km far away and only in 9 years it will reach Pluto. I find the speed of the spacecraft amazing, 50km PER SECOND. Well it will be a long time waiting for results, so get enough beer and pop corn.
[Update 18. Jan. 2006] As I heard today morning in the News, the start has been delayed … well what’s one day more?
