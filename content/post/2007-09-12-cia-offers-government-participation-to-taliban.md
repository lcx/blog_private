According to “[derStandard][1]” the CIA offered the [Taliban][2] (The Taliban (Pashto: طالبان ṭālibān, also anglicized as Taleban) are an extremist, terrorist, and ethnic fundamentalist Sunni Muslim Pashtun movement) participation in Afghan government, if they renounce to connections to Al Qaeda and other terroristic groups. Ok, let me think a minute, as they attacked Afghanistan, didn’t they want to free the people (besides trying to find Bin Laden)?

> On October 7, 2001, the United States, aided by the United Kingdom, Canada, and supported by a coalition of other countries including several from the NATO alliance, initiated military actions in Afghanistan, code named **Operation Enduring Freedom**, and bombed Taliban and Al Qaeda related camps. **The stated intent of military operations was to remove the Taliban from power** because of the Taliban’s refusal to hand over Osama bin Laden for his involvement in the September 11 attacks, and disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations

And let’s look at some pictures, of how Afghanistan was during [Taliban][2] leadership

> The Taliban’s newly-named top field commander has used his first public statement today to warn that new recruits were volunteering as suicide bombers and that Taliban fighters would continue their holy war until Western powers leave Afghanistan.

Sure CIA, that is a wonderful idea!
I wonder why CIA is called Central *Intelligence* Agency
