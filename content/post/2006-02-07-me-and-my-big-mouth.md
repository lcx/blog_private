I hate it when this happens. Yesterday I said "I hope it won't snow this week, since my Passat is in service and the Golf doesn't have winter wheels" well and what was the answer the next day? A huge load of snow! I made it to the metro station with the Golf where I parked the car and then went with public transport to work. It was hard enough to get there, I would never managed to get up the big hill ( Bitterlichstrasse ) with so much snow on the road and summer wheels. Well thank god it rained in the afternoon and the snow was gone again. But this "big mouth" thing gives me an idea, "I hope I won't win in lotto this week" Let's see if this works.
