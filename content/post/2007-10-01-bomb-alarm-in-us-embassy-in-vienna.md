Today a man wanted to enter the US embassy in Vienna with a back pack which initiated an alarm while passing the metal detector. The man fled the scene and dumped the back pack on the street. The back pack was filled with explosive and nails which would have caused some damage. The man was captured and is now being interrogated by the police.
