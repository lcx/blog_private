I just looked at my webalizer stats and noticed, that someone got on my page due to the search term “iban t-com berlin”. So I looked up on google, and guess what, my blog is the first thing displayed when someone searches for the t-com iban in berlin. Great! now [everybody can read how stupid t-com is][1]
