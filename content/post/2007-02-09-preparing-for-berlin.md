Well tomorrow I’m heading to Berlin … not much time left and I didn’t even start to pack my stuff. But I still have time. At least I have started to write down what I should take with me.
I can’t wait to get some doughnuts in my hands.  ok … think I should start doing something … but somehow I don’t quite feel like it. \*sigh\*
