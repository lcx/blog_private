finally some rain … and it cools a bit down. today in the office we hit 32 deg. (sorry, cant find the deg. key on my Mac keyboard) but in my server room at home I still have 33 ,but thanks to xen I can shut down one of my servers, I only have to get some stuff copied to my file server, but since I don’t have NFS installed (don’t want to do it with ftp) I have to wait till tomorrow because I don’t have internet at home ( see [][2] ) ok so let’s see how cool it will get without this server
