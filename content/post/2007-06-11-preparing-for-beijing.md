Today we will go by train from Shanghai to Beijing. A almost 12 hour ride in a Chinese first class sleeping compartment, I am curios if the images [found on the net][1] about the Z class trains really match to the reality. Anyway it doesn’t really matter, what matters is that we arrive in Beijing and can see all the great things, probably the greatest things you can see in China. The Great wall and the Forbidden City. I think you have wasted your life, if you didn’t see the great wall!

Until today (first week) I made about 900 photos and probably in Beijing I will do 900 more
