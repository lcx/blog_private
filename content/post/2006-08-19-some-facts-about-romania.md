What’s with all these blogs about Romania ? No clue, but I just find some of the videos I saw quite interesting.
The first one is about some facts of Romania what has been invented by romanians and I must admit I was quite surprised, didn’t know some of the things myself.
So this blog I will not be criticizing Romania as usual, I think some might have noticed that since quite a while I am criticizing Romania quite a lot and some also might know what this started from, but … I said I won’t criticize in this blog.
Ok [here the video about the interesting facts][1] ( in english!! )
ok and the second one is about tourism again but this commercial, I must admit, is very very good (I hope this one is NOT copied)
I like the idea, this one brings the patriot in me back, at least for some minutes.
so here we go, here is [the next movie][2] thanks for this one, this kind of makes me see things brighter again, and forget about some other things.
