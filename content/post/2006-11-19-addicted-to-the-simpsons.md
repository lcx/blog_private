![simpsons][1] Well what do you say to this? Today after watching over 10 episodes of Simpsons (in which I forgot to turn on my mobile, didn’t check my server and it really did crash … well what would homer say? Doh), I just received a mail (no clue to which list I subscribed, but thanks god I did it ) about the Movie, well I do know about the movie since quite a while and have seen the teaser, but now the Trailer has been released! Go and see it on http://www.thesimpsons.com/
Well I sure du hope they will sell doughnuts instead of Popcorn at the movie. So and instead of reading my apache security book to prevent further crashes on the server … I am going to watch more simpsons episodes
