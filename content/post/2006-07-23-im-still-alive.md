Yes, I survived my short bicycle trip. Only made a few photos, I was to exhausted to make more photos. It took a while to get my bike out since it was covered with car tires, boxes and all sort of other junk. After I pushed the bike to the gas station to fill it with air, my adventure could begin …. god .. that was a strange feeling to ride a bike again. and a bad feeling in the muscles … this sure will hurt tomorrow.
