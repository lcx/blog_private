Winter is over! Oh how I waited for this day ( and many other people also )
Went outside for a walk, I was kind of forced to go outside, but didn’t regret it once I was out. The ice was melting, people where without winter jackets outside, and gues what … the sun was shining
Now what could make this day even better ? Right … 6 doughnuts. This was also a good ocasion to take some pics while the shun is shining and here they are in my gallery
