don’t really have a topic to blog about, or to many things but not in the mood for collecting my thoughts and put them in a blog.
Just sitting in front of my monitor, with a cold beer, and in a (2b || !2b) mood. let’s see how many will figure out what on earth I mean by this
anyway … sitting here, listening to some cuban music over [pandora.com][2] and trying to switch of. This is one of the days where a lot of things go trough my head like memories from the past. Oh yeah … the so called “good old times” I bet everyone has heard of them. I’m not complaining about the actual situation, and I don’t think I would change something, but still, there is this “good old time” thing coming up from time to time … maybe this comes from my inner voice, trying to remind me of some mistakes I did in the past, or rather, just a single one that I regret! All mistakes have it’s learning effect somehow, but there is just this one thing that will no leave me alone, this one think I think I will never forget and never forgive (no, it has got nothing to do with love or things like this).
A different plausible explication why we have this “good old times” feeling as we get older, is because we get “wiser” as we get older. As we where “younger” we where more “stupid” and “naive” and as we get older we see how sick everything around as is. How money can change people and that the world we think we live in, is just something that exists in books and movies. If you look around, corruption, crime, lies, brothers fighting each other, hate, war … all because of money. Most of the people don’t give a fuck about what will happen in the future or how the decision, a politician takes, will effect the feature.
Here I would like to post a little excerpt of “The Poverty of philosophy” by Immortal Technique:

 [2]: http://www.pandora.com

> Latino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism. You see, third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials. But plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and traditionally oppressive European states, force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources.

But this is not only valid for Latin America, it’s valid for the whole world. Don’t want to spend any further words about this topic, I think it’s something one could write days about it and still be pissed and it wouldn’t change a thing
I think I will just end this blog here, without real content, or real ending, sit back, finish my beer, listen to immortal technique and just let my thoughts pass by without transforming them to a blog.
