Great … after 6 months my great 4GB Hitachi Microdrive doesn’t work anymore!
I put it in my card reader, got some pics from it, put it back in the camera and that was it … no reaction anymore. Just some very strange sound. No mater where I connect it, if it’s the camera or the card reader. Good that I had a 512MB CF with me, is enough for some weekend pics.
But no way I will ever buy I Microdrive, I will try to see if hitachi wil change it, since I don’t have the original package anymore which Promarkt requests.
Anyway, It’s broken and in waranty and someone will have to come up with a replacement!
But I’m realy disapointed from the microdrive.
