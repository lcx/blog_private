Here it is, my new "Adorini Humidor Chianti medium" hope it will arrive until Monday. This will give enough space for the cigars I will bring back from Cuba. What a pity for all out of the US that can't enjoy a real Cuban ciagr ( I'm not mean at all, am I?) This was once again one of that lessons … you try to save money and save on the wrong place, a tip for all of you that want a humidor, get a good one right from the beginning. Oh almost forgot to mention, I ordered it yesterday from [Humidor Discount][4] and guess what, they already sent out the package, yesterday …
I'll make some pics when I filled the Humidor
