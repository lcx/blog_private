home sweet home, at last!
When I think back that some time ago I was up to 6 months in Germany, then the 7 weeks I have been in Berlin now could be considered as a short duration trip, but it still feels good to be back home.
My own apartment, my comfortable bed and let’s not forget my 10mbit internet connection. aahhhh that feels good
Ok time go shopping and clean the car, I still have pieces of a ticket I got for wrong parking on the windscreen. It started to rain and it got stuck on my windscreen.
