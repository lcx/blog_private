Where can you go cool down when it’s hot in Vienna? Well there are a lot of places, but one that you should visit is [Krapfenwaldlbad][1] The swimming pools are not really great, but the view will compensate for that. Anyway, I wouldn’t go to often there since it’s to crowded in the small pool. But look at the photos and decide for your self.
