I bought a VIA mini ITX mainboard to make a new firewall, the old one with a Pentium1 166mhz was going a bit slow and since I also wanted to use VPN I needed something better. IPCop was installed quite fast, and a quick search brought me to [this great howto][1]. After setting up VPN I needed a client for Mac OS and I found “[Tunnelblick][2]“, quick installation and everything worked great. Now together with my mobile internet connection I can log in from everywhere and also be secured. Ok but what is it with the topic, out of the box? Well, usually this has some other meaning, but I really mean my IPCop works “out of the box”, I couldn’t find a case where I could fit it in so I just took a cardboard box
