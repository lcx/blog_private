I came to work today with the Metro and was quite surprised to see “Romania” on some windows. Seems that they have invested quite a lot in ads all around Western Europe. The photos you see on the ad quite want to make you go there, but there are 2 things I find real funny, first: there are no photos from the black see, this sure is a place in Romania that you do not really want to visit. Second: The tourism agency in Berlin is on the “Budapester” Street. If you know about a bit of Romanian-Hungarian history then you would understand why I think that this is kind of funny.
