Last week I was at the [Fanfare Ciocărlia][2] concert in “Kesselhaus” Berlin and I also purchased [the new album][3].
It was a very nice concert and it is nice to see that there still are some people out there that keep on to tradition and culture and didn’t choose the easy way making money by playing crap music, like manele.

Thank you Fanfare Ciocărlia for your great music!
