# Wish you were here

I just discovered this post in my draft folder. Here I am rambling on about not
not putting things off for tomorrow and here lies this dormant piece since ten
whole months.

## Short Intro and spoiler alert

This book turned out to become one of my favorite books. It’s probably hard to
describe emotions and feelings with words and give you the same ideas I had
while reading this book, all the images that were triggered in my mind to
create this wonderful story combined with my own thoughts, experiences, and
emotions, but I’ll give it a try.

If you want to read this book, stop reading this, it contains spoilers and will
ruin the best part of the book.

## The Island

In the first part where Diana goes to the Galapagos right before the lockdown
started (without her boyfriend who was forced to stay in New you’re since he
was a doctor, this fact is important later), I was living the stories on the
island in my mind, I could see myself there, in that small apartment provided
by “Abuela”, the uncertainty of how and when I would be able to get back but at
the same time the forced break from reality, from tasks, from everyday duties
and life as I am used to. No internet access, no phone contact with the rest of
the world, no money. Just alone with nature and myself. Coincidentally this
“being on a faraway tropical island” is my go-to thought when shit gets too
much to handle, this romanticized thought of a “simple” life when in reality
living on an almost deserted island is anything else but simple. Let alone that
this is something I would never do to my two girls, just the thought about it
stings and reeks like abandonment. But this very subject is also covered in the
book, how Diana's mother left, traveling the world as a famous photographer not
being present in her life at all and her dad being her only parent, which died
in an accident at work, life-changing in a heartbeat. After his death noticing
the last text message he sent

> “Are you busy?”

And that message was left unanswered on Diana's phone.

How often do I take things for granted, or feel too busy for something and just
shove it off for the next day, the next day that might never come? Before the
Island, Diana had a plan for her life, what job, at what age to have how many
kids … Then after two weeks on the island turned into four without quarantine
being lifted and without a way back home … she almost drowned but got rescued
at the last minute …

## what the f***???

… just to wake up … back in the US … in a hospital finding
out that she was on a respirator after contracting Covid. … Fuck? What? The
island never happened? She never went? This was all a dream? While she
struggles to accept reality, even I didn’t want to accept this, I want back on
the island, this reality can’t be real, how can this all just be a dream? No,
where all those nice people helping on the island, that “simple life”, the
swims in the warm water, beach, sun …

While slowly going through painful physiotherapy, and learning basic things
again she keeps on thinking about that other life, searching for the people she
met on the island and reevaluating her life and her plan for her life after she
almost died. When her boyfriend finally proposed to her, something she had been
expecting and looking forward to, before the whole island thing (that never
happened), … they instead broke up. Leaving him confused about what happened,
and why this happened even if she told him he didn’t do anything wrong and her
finally accepting that her short (non-existing) trip to the island made her
plans vanish in thin air. Nobody is at fault, dealing with an outcome that
society tells us is broken when in reality nothing broke, nothing bad happened,
nothing anyone did wrong, and yet, painful and searching for something or
someone to blame.

## You can't plan your life

> "You can't plan your life … Because then you have a plan. Not a life."

This is painful and relieving at the same time. Nothing is forever, and while
it can last forever, it’s not a given and not something you should rely on.
Take it if it happens, but also enjoy the ride while it lasts, and take it if
it doesn't last forever. People change but don’t notice the change in themself
let alone the change in others. Too busy keeping the status quo alive and
having no time with yourself, checking in on your values and if the current
state still fits into what we have become now. Afraid of taking action,
adjusting your life to whatever you have decided to be different, doing things
instead, that are comfortable, and expected by others and society.

Another quote from the book

> I learned the hard way that you shouldn't stay with someone because of your
> past together-what matters more is if you want the same things in the future.

I was also lacking a proper response to the fact of not searching for an answer
to things that happened in my past and this is exactly what I was searching
for:

> Trying to figure out what happened to me isn't important. It's what I do with
> what I've learned that counts.

It might sound crazy, but sometimes there just isn't an answer to be found, and
remaining stuck on trying to find one is no solution.

I’m finishing this off with  even more lines from the book:

> The future is going to come, in some form, whether we like it or not. What we
> really mean is that we can't plan for the future. And when we can't plan-when
> we can't find those patterns that make sense-we lose the skeleton of life.
> And no one can remain upright without that.

This, especially for a person like me that needs a plan, and lives by a
calendar is something that scares the shit out of me. Accepting the
un-plannable future, living in the moment, and making the most out of every day
or at least trying to do that. Of course, this doesn’t mean having zero plans
at all but accepting that there are things we can’t plan and we can’t control.
Don’t overthink things, try new things, don’t put off things, and come up with
stupid excuses without even trying. Don’t put off frightening things, there
might not be a tomorrow or you might be missing out on something great.

## The takeaway?

I kind of lack the proper mindset now to write a takeaway on this. It was stuck
in my draft for so long that I'm not in the same emotional mindset as I was
after reading this even if while checking this post, a lot of memories from the
book came back. I will let you come to your conclusion and I hope I didn't
spoil this book even if I gave away the plot twist in the book. There still is
enough room to trigger thoughts and help raise some questions about your life
and the decissions you have taken.
