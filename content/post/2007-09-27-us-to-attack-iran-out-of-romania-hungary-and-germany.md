According to tomorrows release of the Romanian newspaper “[Ziua][1]” the US is planing to attack Iran out of Romania, Hungary and Germany. Not so sure how good this source is the only fact that is sure is that the CIA boss, Michael Hayden, was on a unannounced trip to Romania, this can also be read in “[Jurnalul National][2]“

I can only hope that Romania will not get involved into this, but as the past has shown, Romania is very good at kissing USA’s ass.
