I was just playing around with some features of Aperture after watching some tutorial movies. Now this is a great piece of software, thank you apple! I would like to demonstrate what big difference you achieve by editing the photos. Of course you could just do it right with the camera, but I don't earn my money with this so it's ok for me if my photos are not perfect and need a retouch on the mac.  First, the original one, then one edited slightly in iPhoto and the last one just played around in Aperture with Heights and Shadows, now I love the result of the last one.
