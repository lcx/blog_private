Recently (I created this draft 4 years ago!) I was asked in what language I think and count/calculate ... I had to think a while as I couldn't quite answer it from the top of my head.

For those who don't know me, I speak three languages and not because I was raised multilingual but because I was in a country where I had to learn that language. Born in Romania so I learned Romanian then I lived in Australia after which we moved to Austria so here came English and German to the mix.

As for which language I think in, well it depends :) it depends on the context and what I'm thinking about. Am I thinking about what to write in this blog post which I knew I would write in English, well then my thinking was in English. Am I thinking about some client meeting where I have to talk German then I think about it in German. Last but not least comes Romanian, the same rules apply here, would I be thinking about something I would write in Romanian or some topic with my family then my thinking is in Romanian as well.

It also depends on who am I am thinking about and what language I speak to those people, this will influence the language I think in.

## Mashup

There is one thing I really hate, that is mashing up multiple languages in a sentence. Sorry but that's a no-go, pick a language and stick with it.
