I didn’t watch MTV or VIVA since a long long time (over a year if not already two). First of all, the music they play is mostly crap. Second, the commercials, the ring tone commercials are just unbearable! Then they have got so many stupid shows. ehmmm… wasn’t MTV supposed to be “Music Television”? So who needs shows about the 16th birthday of some stupid kids? No matter if anybody knows them or not. Anyway, gotv also has commercials (why shouldn’t they) but they have maximum one commercial about ring tones and way on a higher IQ level then the stupid commercials from MTV.
Enough complaining today, it’s way to hot …
