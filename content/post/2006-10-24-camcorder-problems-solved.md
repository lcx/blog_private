Finally after so much time it came to my mind to ask in some forum what the problem could be. After a search on google I cam across a [german video editing forum, digitalvideoschnitt.][1]
I [got a reply][2] quite fast and I just tried it out and it worked. The problems seems to be when the camera is plugged in to the source! The problems don’t occur when running on battery! The problem seems to occur because of a ground loop since there are 2 grounds, the firewire and the source. Sounds strange but it works and that’s what counts!
