summary: Austria isn’t a burger country, of course, you find places where you can
  eat burgers but can’t find good buns you could buy if you want burgers. So the only
  solution is to make it yourself.

title: Simple Burger Buns

Like with every recipe it starts with a search online so I took the first result duckduckgo gave me and it was a slam dunk!

There isn't much to add to this recipe, it just works, almost zero effort (throw everything in the mixer and leave it to rest for several hours).

Look at me going all backer-man where do I find the time for all this you might ask, well it's quite amazing how much time you have if you just stop being "busy" all the time. I'm working less, still getting work stuff done, leaving office at a reasonable time, and even enjoying time with the kids. I made these buns while also playing with the kids and going with them on a bike ride. If I could send this post to myself 2 months ago I would not believe that this is me.

Ok, I'm starting to derail the purpose of this post so let's get back to the buns.

I know, the buns don't look that much like buns, I have to work on the looks but it was only a test run to see how they are and they're both easy to make and delicious.
