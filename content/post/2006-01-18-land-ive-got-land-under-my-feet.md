Finaly back on the ground. This was one bad landing, the takeoff was perfect, the flight pleasent and without toubulance but as the plane started sinking for landing it was like a three dimensional rollercoaster. I felt my heart beating like I was on a 200km marathon, not even Moga’s mountain manages this, and I was sweating like I was in the sauna, but I have to say it was hot in the plain, realy !
Anyway, after leaving the plain I kind of fealt the necessity to knee down and kiss the floor, but I could control my self and save the other passengers from this entertaining moment.
Oh how is it great to feel good solid ground under the feet !
