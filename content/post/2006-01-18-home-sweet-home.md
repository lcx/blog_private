Finaly … my last day in Stuttgart, in about 3 hours my plane to Vienna will take of.
Not that I don’t like Stuttgart, but in 2005 I have spent only 5 months at home and I think I need some time at home, visit some friends and stuff like this.
So I will try not to do so many on site visits at customers this year to do a lot of things that still are on my to-do list but which I couldn’t do since I wasn’t at home.
Ok enough of this for now, have to finish some things and then take a taxi to the airport.
I wonder if the reservation of the car to pick me up worked, never received a confirmation from C&K.
