So here I am, my last in berlin and I had to move to my favourite hotel, hotel panorama. Do you know the beds from the 80s, with a radio clock in the middle? Thats exactly what I have here. Anyway it could have been worse so I will not complaint. The worst thing was the amount of baggage I had with me in berlin. It took me about a hour to get all my stuff in the car and the guy from the reception looked a bit strange. But after this week I will finaly have holiday, beach, sun and fine cigars.
