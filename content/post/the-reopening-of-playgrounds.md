title: The reopening of playgrounds
---


It’s finally happening, playgrounds are reopening as of the 4th of May. This does make me happy at first but also worries me as it does provide some challenges when you think a bit about it. Corona is still here and there still is a social distancing law in place where you have to keep space between other people.

This confirms what I was suspecting, parents are responsible for their kids to keep a distance. How am I supposed to do that with a 3-year-old, I honestly don’t think I can get my 7-year-old to follow this rule. These will be challenging times and if the police will be so trigger happy with fines as they where until now, getting a 500 Euro fine for going to the playground will not be fun.But then again, Kindergarten is opening up as well as schools. Even if they split classes in half and have kindergarten children stay in the garden all day, there is no way one can prevent kids from touching when they play.All in all, I am still happy to get things running again, I really hope we can keep it this way and keep this virus in check until there is a vaccine.
