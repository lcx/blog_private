Transparency International has release [the Corruption Perceptions Index for 2007][1] on the radio they where mostly talking about Austria being 15th this year. More interesting for me was where Romania is … but before I tell you this here some other highlights.

Taiwan … is rank 34, but no sign of Romania … Botswana – 38, still no sign of Romania, Namibia – 57 … and you guessed, no sign of Romania, Kuweit – 60 and believe it or not, still no sign of Romania, Bulgaria – 64, Colombia – 68 and finally Romania – 69 !
What a great achievement to be more corrupt the Colombia!

To quote a very good Romanian short movie “[Un cartuș de Kent și un pachet de cafea][2]”

> Mulțumiri domnului Adrian Năstase pentru condițiile create

Which means “Thanks to Mr. [Adrian Năstase][3] for the created conditions” but this “Thank You” can be extended to contain names like [Băsescu][4], [Videanu][5], [Tăriceanu][6], ... and many many many more. All of them leading the country with only one idea in mind, how to get richer ... "[Fuck you Romania][7]"
If someone might think I hate Romania, this is very wrong, I just hate the people in charge!
