oh no, my internet is not working today, blizznet seems to have some DNS problems, almos al .at domains are being resolved, and .. heise.de …. strange. anyway, this gives me some time to relax and forget about computers, go smoke a cigar, drink some cuban rum and write a blog. write a blog? without a internet connection?
well thanks to my neighbor which hasn’t set up his wireless router correct I do have internet
but I won’t abuse it, I will only use it to read my mails and write this blog, I promise
