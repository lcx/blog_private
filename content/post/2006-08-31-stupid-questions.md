I love this message from the Hitachi RMA, hmm… what should I press?  I agree or I don't agree?
The best thing was, they REALY asked me this also on the phone !



In order to create a RMA, please read and respond to the following:

Export Compliance Certification

By clicking the "I agree" button, I agree that Hitachi GST products will not be used for the design, development, manufacturing, testing, stockpiling, or use of biological, nuclear, missile or chemical weapons.
