Since Gallery 2 has now been released since a while and isn’t beta anymore I thought it would be time to give it a try and see how it looks like and how the administration is. Well… I can only say &quot;wow&quot; this realy is a great piece of software !The import from Gallery 1 was so easy, I just needed the Path to my old album and then some clicks and some coffee to wait till the import finishes  since it took quite a while for almos 3000 pics.So here it is, my first album with gallery 2
