as you can see I switched to WordPress
the import from RSS was quite simple but all html tags have been scrambled so I hat heaps of < and > to change back so my content will display. Anyway I am ( for the moment ) happy with wordpress but time will show how good the decision was.
The instalation is quite simple, not that serendipity (s9y) installation was more complicated, but if you intent to do a installation for more users with only one codebase wordpress ofers a more simple posibility or rather the debian package delivers a good configuration for this purpose.

So happy blogging with wordpress
